## Runtime prerequisite and installation

Resolve the skill root and select any available Python 3.11+ interpreter. Do not assume a
launcher name. The examples use `PPTX_PYTHON` for the selected interpreter:

```bash
SKILL_ROOT="/absolute/path/to/skills/pptx"
PPTX_PYTHON="/path/to/selected/python"
PPTX_TOOL="$SKILL_ROOT/scripts/pptx_tool.py"
PPTX_SMOKE_TEST="$SKILL_ROOT/scripts/smoke_test.py"
"$PPTX_PYTHON" -c 'import sys; print(sys.version.split()[0]); raise SystemExit(0 if sys.version_info >= (3, 11) else "Python 3.11+ is required")'
```

Check the required imports. Before installing anything, tell the user what is missing, what
will be installed, the target scope, and the installer. Use the selected interpreter's
`-m pip` with the pinned file:

```bash
"$PPTX_PYTHON" -m pip install -r "$SKILL_ROOT/requirements.txt"
```

Prefer the active or user interpreter. If platform policy blocks those scopes, explain the
fallback before using a local environment. Use the normal platform package manager for a
missing interpreter or optional LibreOffice; prefer Homebrew on macOS when available. Never
use privileged pip or `--break-system-packages`, and do not edit host-project dependency
metadata. Use the same `PPTX_PYTHON` for installation, tools, and smoke tests.

## Invocation and result contract

Run the tool with the same active interpreter used to install requirements. Quote every resolved
path so skill locations and documents containing spaces remain safe:

```bash
"$PPTX_PYTHON" "$PPTX_TOOL" inspect "/path/to/input deck.pptx"
"$PPTX_PYTHON" "$PPTX_TOOL" create --job "/path/to/create job.json" --output "/path/to/output deck.pptx"
"$PPTX_PYTHON" "$PPTX_TOOL" edit "/path/to/input deck.pptx" --job "/path/to/edit job.json" --output "/path/to/output deck.pptx"
"$PPTX_PYTHON" "$PPTX_TOOL" convert "/path/to/input deck.pptx" --output "/path/to/output deck.pdf"
"$PPTX_PYTHON" "$PPTX_SMOKE_TEST"
```

Use `--overwrite` to replace an existing destination. A template/source and destination must
always be distinct paths; `--overwrite` applies only to a separate destination and never enables
in-place mutation. `--job -` reads a job from stdin and resolves relative resource paths from the
current directory. A job file resolves them from its own directory.

Every successful stdout document is JSON with:

- `schema_version`, `success`, and `operation`;
- operation-specific counts and warnings;
- exact Python/library versions;
- source/output paths;
- `verification`, including package preflight, reopen, slide order/count, existence of internal
  relationship targets, resolution of owner XML relationship references, and atomic publication
  where applicable.

Failures are one JSON object on stderr and use a nonzero stable status. Do not parse human usage
text to determine failure type.

## Safe package handling

Preflight accepts only local `.pptx` ZIP packages with required PresentationML parts. It rejects:

- wrong extensions or signatures, encrypted ZIP members, macros, or `vbaProject.bin`;
- absolute, parent-traversing, backslash, duplicate, or symbolic-link ZIP entries;
- more than 5,000 members, more than 512 MiB expanded data, a member over 64 MiB, suspicious
  compression ratios, unsupported ZIP compression, or a source over 100 MiB;
- OOXML `.xml`, `.rels`, or `.vml` members containing a DTD or entities; malformed or orphan
  relationship parts; duplicate/malformed relationship IDs; broken internal targets; unresolved
  owner `r:id`/`r:embed`/`r:link` references in those XML-based members; missing slide targets;
  duplicate slide IDs; or unreachable slide parts.

XML is parsed with DTD loading, external entities, network access, and huge-tree mode disabled.
External hyperlinks are counted but never followed. Macro-enabled `.pptm` files are unsupported.
Inspection removes URL userinfo and replaces values of credential-, token-, session-, signature-,
and secret-like query parameters with `<redacted>` while preserving useful scheme/host/path,
ordinary query fields, duplicate keys, and fragments. Reported hyperlink URLs are therefore safe
representations rather than byte-identical source values.

## Inspect

`inspect INPUT.pptx` returns:

- slide size, core properties, masters, layouts, slide IDs/order/layouts;
- every shape's stable shape ID, name, type, placeholder metadata, and geometry in EMU/inches;
- text frames with ordered paragraphs, levels, alignment, runs, font properties, and field
  warnings;
- image filename/type/byte count/dimensions/SHA-256;
- table cell text and chart type/title/categories/series values available through public APIs;
- plain speaker-note text read from package XML without creating a notes part;
- package feature warnings for signatures, comments, SmartArt, embedded objects, media,
  transitions, animations, and other uncertain content.

Inspection is read-only. Unsupported chart metadata is reported as a warning rather than invented.

## Create jobs

A create job has this top-level shape:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "operation": "create",
  "template": "brand-template.pptx",
  "keep_template_slides": false,
  "metadata": {"title": "Quarterly review", "author": "Analyst"},
  "slides": []
}
```

`template` is optional. Without one, `python-pptx`'s default presentation is used. With one, the
template's masters and layouts are retained. Existing template slides are removed by default;
set `keep_template_slides` to `true` to retain them. Template removal uses the same pinned,
reopen-verified relationship adapter as edit operations.

A slide may select a `layout` with either `{"name": "Exact Layout Name"}` or `{"index": 1}`.
If `layout` is omitted, layout index 1 is used and must exist. Duplicate layout names are
ambiguous. Supported slide keys are `title`, `body`, `elements`, and `notes`.

## Edit jobs

An edit job contains ordered operations:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "operation": "edit",
  "operations": [
    {"action": "replace_text", "find": "Old", "replace": "New"},
    {"action": "set_notes", "slide": {"slide_id": 256}, "text": "Plain notes"}
  ]
}
```

Supported actions:

- `add_slide`: use a create-style slide object under `slide`; append by default or provide an
  insertion `index`.
- `replace_text`: provide `find`, `replace`, optional slide/shape selectors, and exactly one of
  `replace_all: true` or `occurrence` when the selection is not unique.
- `update_table`: select one table and provide an exact-size `data` matrix or `cells` entries
  such as `{"row": 1, "column": 2, "text": "42"}`.
- `update_chart`: select one chart and provide a complete category or XY chart data specification.
- `replace_image`: select one picture and provide `path`. The replacement must use the same media
  content type. Geometry/crop and unselected picture relationships remain unchanged; the selected
  picture receives a relationship to the validated replacement image.
- `set_notes`: select a slide and provide plain `text`.
- `remove_slide`: select exactly one slide.
- `reorder_slides`: provide `slide_ids` containing every current slide ID exactly once.

After every add, remove, or reorder, the adapter saves a checkpoint, runs safe preflight, reopens
it, and verifies retained IDs, exact order/count, internal target existence, and owner
relationship-reference resolution before continuing. The adapter is enabled only for the pinned
`python-pptx` version.

## Selectors and replacement rules

Slide indexes are zero-based and refer to the current operation state. Prefer
`{"slide_id": 256}` over `{"slide_index": 0}`. Shape selectors support exact `shape_name`,
zero-based `shape_index`, or a type-local zero-based `table_index`, `chart_index`, or
`image_index`. Indexes apply to the complete selected slide scope; without a slide selector that
scope is the whole deck. This deck-wide behavior applies consistently to text, table, chart, and
image operations. A selector must identify exactly one object. Omitting `shape` is allowed only
when the selected slide/deck scope itself contains exactly one shape; the tool never silently
chooses the first shape.

Replacement searches each paragraph's ordered runs. A match inside one run preserves that run's
formatting. A cross-run match is rejected unless `formatting_policy` is `"first_run"`; replacement
text then uses the first matched run's formatting while unmatched prefixes/suffixes retain their
runs. Matches crossing paragraphs, fields, or incompatible hyperlink boundaries are rejected.
Set `destructive_reconstruction: true` only to replace within a flattened text frame and accept
loss of run/paragraph formatting, fields, and hyperlink structure. Empty search strings are
invalid.

## Content specifications

All geometry uses inches:

```json
{"x": 1.0, "y": 1.5, "width": 6.0, "height": 2.0}
```

`title` may be a string or a paragraph object. `body` is a string or paragraph list. A paragraph
supports `text` or `runs`, `level` (0-8), and `alignment` (`left`, `center`, `right`, `justify`).
A run supports `text`, `bold`, `italic`, `font_name`, `font_size`, and six-digit `color`.

Elements:

- Text: `{"type":"text","name":"Callout","box":{...},"paragraphs":[...]}`
- Image: `{"type":"image","name":"Photo","path":"photo.png","box":{...}}`; omit height or width
  to preserve aspect ratio.
- Table: `{"type":"table","name":"Data","box":{...},"data":[["A","B"],["1","2"]]}`.
- Category chart:
  `{"type":"chart","chart_type":"column","name":"Chart","box":{...},"categories":["Q1"],"series":[{"name":"Sales","values":[10]}]}`.
- XY chart:
  `{"type":"chart","chart_type":"scatter","name":"Chart","box":{...},"series":[{"name":"Fit","points":[[1,2],[2,4]]}]}`.

Chart types are `column`, `bar`, `line`, `line_markers`, `pie`, `doughnut`, `area`, `scatter`,
and `scatter_lines`. Add `title` and `has_legend` as needed. Tables and charts remain editable.
Notes are plain text only. Resource files are bounded and validated before use. Images are limited
to 50 MiB compressed, 20,000 pixels per dimension, 50 million pixels, one frame, and an estimated
200 MiB decoded raster. Each image path is read once into a bounded immutable byte snapshot;
Pillow validation, full decode, and `python-pptx` ingestion all consume that same snapshot.

## LibreOffice prerequisite

LibreOffice is optional and needed only for PPTX-to-PDF conversion. PPTX-to-PDF remains a
source-format operation owned and validated by this skill; do not hand it off as PDF-native
editing. Before conversion, verify an executable is on `PATH`:

```bash
command -v soffice || command -v libreoffice
```

If conversion is requested and the executable is missing, obtain user approval before installing
the optional system package. First state that LibreOffice is missing, that the optional
LibreOffice system package will be installed, its system scope, and the platform package-manager
mechanism. Use the platform's normal package manager, preferring Homebrew on macOS when available,
then repeat the PATH check.

Stop with an external-precondition failure if neither command resolves after installation. Do not
claim conversion support merely because LibreOffice's application files exist.

## Convert

`convert` supports PPTX to PDF only and requires `soffice` or `libreoffice` on `PATH`. It:

1. preflights the source and rejects any external relationship;
2. launches headless LibreOffice with a fresh isolated user profile and configurable
   `--timeout` (default 120 seconds) in a minimal environment;
3. bounds and sanitizes diagnostics, including paths, URL credentials, and secret-like values;
4. checks the PDF signature, opens it with `pypdf`, and requires one PDF page per slide;
5. atomically publishes the requested destination.

Inspection and every template/source-backed create/edit/convert operation consume a validated
immutable source snapshot. Immediately before atomic publication, the live source path must still
match that snapshot. An immediate post-publication comparison reports an observed source race by
setting `verification.post_publish_source_changed: true` and emitting a warning, without turning
the committed operation into a contradictory failure. Thus `source_unchanged_at_publish_gate`
proves the decisive pre-commit check, not indefinite immutability of the path after commit.

Conversion is best effort. Always visually review typography, line wrapping, charts, and media in
the target environment.

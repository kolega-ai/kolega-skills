# DOCX

Use the bundled deterministic CLI for WordprocessingML work. Treat every source document as
untrusted and immutable unless the user explicitly authorizes overwrite.

## Route the task

- Use this skill for creating, reading, inspecting, editing, or converting `.docx` files.
- Keep DOCX-to-PDF work here because conversion begins from the DOCX source.
- Route PDF-native editing or extraction to `pdf`, spreadsheets to `xlsx`, and presentations
  to `pptx`.

## Workflow

1. Resolve the skill root and choose any available Python 3.11+ interpreter; do not assume a
   launcher name. Check the required imports before installing anything. If something is
   missing, first tell the user what you intend to install, where, and with which installer.
   Use the selected interpreter's `-m pip` for the pinned requirements. Use the platform's
   package manager for Python or optional LibreOffice, preferring Homebrew on macOS when
   available. A local environment is a fallback, not a prerequisite. See
   [environment setup](references/operations.md#environment).
2. Read [the operation contract](references/operations.md) before constructing a job. Read
   [the examples](references/examples.md) for copy-pasteable invocations.
3. Inspect an existing document before editing. Review ordered blocks, styles, runs, sections,
   headers, footers, fields, drawings, comments, revisions, unsupported parts, and warnings.
4. Prefer named styles and template inheritance over direct formatting. Use the public CLI
   instead of ad hoc package mutation.
5. Write to a distinct destination. Use `--overwrite` only after explicit authorization.
6. Reinspect the output and verify structure, expected text, styles, tables, images, stories,
   and fields. Optionally render with LibreOffice to review pagination and layout.
7. Report warnings and preservation uncertainty. Never promise perfect round-trip fidelity.

## Safety rules

- Do not bypass OOXML preflight, ZIP expansion limits, signature checks, or post-write reopen
  validation.
- Never use `sudo pip`, any interpreter under `sudo` to run pip, or pip's
  `--break-system-packages` option. Do not add these packages to the host project's dependency
  metadata.
- Reject macro-enabled, encrypted, malformed, or oversized packages.
- Reject DOCX external relationships by default. Use the documented explicit opt-in only after
  review; it permits processing and does not provide network isolation for LibreOffice or
  another consumer.
- Keep edits explicit and bounded. Supply expected replacement counts and use the first-run
  policy only when a cross-run replacement is intentional.
- Do not flatten text across hyperlinks, fields, drawings, comments, or revisions.
- Use public `python-docx` APIs for ordinary content. The CLI confines narrow OOXML helpers to
  field markup, block placement, and image relationship replacement.
- Remember that page-number and TOC fields are markup only. Pagination and TOC refresh require
  a layout application.
- Keep PDF conversion within the generated-PDF byte/page/text-extraction and decompressed-stream
  bounds. LibreOffice runs with an isolated profile and process group so timeout cleanup
  reaches ordinary descendants; those lifecycle controls are not a network sandbox.

## Resources

- Read [operations](references/operations.md) for the stable CLI, job schemas, exit statuses,
  and atomic-write behavior.
- Read [examples](references/examples.md) when preparing or debugging a job.
- Read [limitations](references/limitations.md) before promising fidelity or advanced Word
  features.
- Read [provenance](references/provenance.md) for official documentation, pinned versions,
  and dependency-license review.
- Run [`scripts/docx_tool.py`](scripts/docx_tool.py) for production operations.
- Run [`scripts/smoke_test.py`](scripts/smoke_test.py) after installation to verify the active
  environment. Add `--require-libreoffice` when PDF conversion must be tested.

## Final verification

Confirm that the source remains unchanged unless overwrite was authorized, the destination
reopens, requested structures are present, warnings were reviewed, and no temporary files or
generated fixtures remain in the skill directory.
